# Java_Sort

Code that implements a bubble sort.

AUTHOR: Nikolo Sperberg
DISCRIPTION: This program takes in a txt file of ponies with ages.  It will then put all of the ponies in an array.  Next this program will sort the ponies by age.  Finally, the program will print out the ponies in order, but skip any ponies with the same age.

Taking O(1) space means that the space required for the algorithm to run is constant.  This means that by creating only one array, the program is using constant space.   

For my algorithm I wrote my own bubble sort.  The worst case run time of my algorithm is n^2.
